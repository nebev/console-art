## What? Why?

The Javascript console is a place for developers and text, right?

Well it's a little known fact that the most major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) allow some level of customisation to the console, and that includes <span style="color:blue">C</span><span style="color:red">O</span><span style="color:green">L</span><span style="color:orange">O</span><span style="color:purple">U</span><span style="color:pink">R</span><span style="color:aqua">S</span> (Sorry, I'm not American).

So the next logical step of course is to create console art. This quick little utility allows you to simply drag and drop images and get the Javascript to display images on your own site. Wow your frontend devs... or something.
